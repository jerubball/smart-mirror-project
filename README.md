## Details

We used Pi-cam on Raspberry Pi for main machine. Raspberry Pi is then attached to the back of a monitor, and put up in portrait orientation. The monitor is also covered with two-way mirror.

Upon execution of smart mirror program, the program will take photo every 5 to 10 seconds, recognizing the face, if present, from pre-existing database. Once user can be identified, related customized contents may be displayed.
